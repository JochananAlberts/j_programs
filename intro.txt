You are sitting in a dimly lit lab filled with idle machines.
There are no engineers or sysadmins around you. A workstation in front of you blinks with half-written code, tangled Ethernet cables, a mechanical keyboard missing a keycap, and a stack of unopened network logs. Through the glass wall you glimpse a server rack; no blue team is guarding it (as far as you can tell).
Behind you, a heavy steel door leads to a corridor humming with routers and the faint glow of status LEDs. The ceiling is layered with fiber lines, the floor resonating with the pulse of hidden packets. You feel the presence of Wi-Fi in the air; somewhere deep in the building a printer grinds endlessly, spitting out pages of corrupted text.
